					<h4><i>"I had the opportunity to work closely with Jonathan on two large, semester long projects. Jonathan was a key component to the successful completion of these projects. As the project manager for these projects, I relied heavily on Jonathan's knowledge and strong work ethic. Throughout the semester, I frequently turned to Jonathan to complete additional work because he continuously produced such high quality results. He never hesitated to take on additional responsibilities including leading a group throughout the semester. It was a pleasure working with Jonathan and any organization would be lucky to have him."</i><br><div style="text-align: right; margin-right: 20px;">-Katherine Flores</div></h4><br>

					<h3>About this Project</h3>
					<h4>This academic project was a semester long assignment to create a software requirements specification (SRS) document and a software design description document (SDD). These documents describe an android-based mobile application idea that I came up with to help organize items in a user’s kitchen pantry. In this course, a project manager was elected (Katherine Flores) who then organized the class of about 30 students into small teams, each with a leader. I was selected as one of these team leaders and worked in a managerial capacity for the duration of each project. </h4><br>

						<h4>Meanwhile in another class I was enrolled in that semester, our assigned project was to work in small groups to create a mobile application of our choice. My group chose to create the above application, which we later named “Stockpile”.
